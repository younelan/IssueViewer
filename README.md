# Issue Viewer

Simple Jira Viewer using the Database. This is not meant as a full project management tool but should at least allow to show issues.

## About
This project was started because Atlassian Stopped supporting on prem and forced to moved to their cloud server. I ended up with a defunct Jira Server which I had to take down because it was end of Life

This is what I like to release 0.02 , my 2 cents
